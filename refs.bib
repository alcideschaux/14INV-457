abstract = {PURPOSE: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening is responsible for a profound clinical stage migration in newly detected prostate cancers. Extracapsular extension (ECE) is an important predictor of outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP). We examined trends in the rate of ECE for cancers detected by PSA screening in 731 RP specimens between 1987 and 1997, when screening became routine urologic practice in the United States.

METHODS: The rates of ECE were examined in 311 prostates with nonpalpable (stage T1c) disease and 420 with palpable but clinically localized (stage T2) disease. Specimens were step-sectioned and examined by a senior pathologist. Rates of ECE were compared with respect to time, and logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ECE.

RESULTS: The rate of ECE decreased from 81\% to 36\% during the 10-year observation period. Multivariateanalysis involving clinical tumor stage, preoperative serum PSA level, and Gleason score demonstrated that year of treatment was an independent predictor of ECE, with a two-fold reduction of risk occurring during the study period (P <. 001; odds ratio, 1.96; 95\% confidence interval, 1.37 to 2.78).

CONCLUSION: PSA screening has resulted in a downward trend in pathologic stage in clinically localized prostate cancer, independent of preoperative PSA level, tumor stage, and Gleason score. This time-dependent downward stage migration suggests the need for continuous updating of predictive nomograms and caution in interpreting differences in contemporarily treated patients compared with historical controls. Further study is needed to determine whether this trend will translate into improved disease-free survival.},

@article{Schroder2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer was initiated in the early 1990s to evaluate the effect of screening with prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) testing on death rates from prostate cancer.

METHODS: We identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years through registries in seven European countries for inclusion in our study. The men were randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and ended on December 31, 2006.

RESULTS: In the screening group, 82\% of men accepted at least one offer of screening. During a median follow-up of 9 years, the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was 8.2\% in the screening group and 4.8\% in the control group. The rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group, as compared with the control group, was 0.80 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.98; adjusted P=0.04). The absolute risk difference was 0.71 death per 1000 men. This means that 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 additional cases of prostate cancer would need to be treated to prevent one death from prostate cancer. The analysis of men who were actually screened during the first round (excluding subjects with noncompliance) provided a rate ratio for death from prostate cancer of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.56 to 0.90).

CONCLUSIONS: PSA-based screening reduced the rate of death from prostate cancer by 20\% but was associated with a high risk of overdiagnosis. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN49127736.)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure recent changes in prostate-cancer mortality across 24 developed countries.

METHODS: Mortality data for men aged 50-79 years were obtained from the World Health Organisation mortality database and we assessed trends in age-standardised mortality rates using joinpoint regression models.

RESULTS: Significant reductions in prostate-cancer mortality were observed in United Kingdom, United States, Austria, Canada, Italy, France, Germany, Australia and Spain, and downward trends were also observable in the Netherlands, Ireland and Sweden.

CONCLUSIONS: Mortality declines for prostate cancer are now evident in 12 out of the 24 developed countries considered in this analysis. Increases in PSA screening and better treatment of early-stage disease, possibly acting in combination, remain plausible hypotheses.},
